          Welcome to my website, there is much to see. Everything from my past
          school projects to personal projects that I work on in my free time.
          In the about me and personal project sections, you can learn more
          about myself and what I like to do on my own.

          I have worked on many projects in my past. Four of my favorite
          projects can be found within this website. These projects include a
          board game, a calculator, a house selling company, and information on
          the environment. These projects were all very important for helping me
          understand programming concepts and teamwork and communication skills.
